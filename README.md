# Sales Forecasting Project
## Overview
This repository contains a sales forecasting project completed using Microsoft Excel. The project demonstrates three different methods for forecasting sales data:

Forecasting Using Formulae (=FORECAST() function)
Graph Trendline
Forecast Sheet
The data used for the forecasting was generated with the assistance of ChatGPT.

## Methods
### 1. Forecasting Using Formulae
This method involves calculating sales forecasts using the =FORECAST() function in Excel. The =FORECAST() function predicts future values based on historical data.

Steps:

Prepare Historical Data: Arrange the historical sales data in columns.
Apply Forecast Formula: Use the =FORECAST() function to estimate future sales. The syntax is =FORECAST(x, known_ys, known_xs), where x is the target date, known_ys are the historical sales data, and known_xs are the corresponding dates.
Analyze Results: Compare the forecasted values with actual values (if available) to validate accuracy.
### 2. Graph Trendline
In this method, you visualize the data on a chart and apply a trendline to project future sales.

Steps:

Create a Chart: Plot the historical sales data on a line chart.
Add a Trendline: Add a trendline to the chart. Excel will automatically fit the best line to the data.
Configure the Trendline: Display the equation and R-squared value on the chart.
Extend the Trendline: Forecast future sales by extending the trendline beyond the historical data.
### 3. Forecast Sheet
The Forecast Sheet feature in Excel provides automated forecasting using advanced statistical methods.

Steps:

Select Data: Highlight the historical sales data.
Generate Forecast Sheet: Navigate to the Data tab and select Forecast Sheet.
Configure Forecast: Set the forecast end date and adjust settings like confidence intervals.
Review Forecast: The generated sheet will include forecasted sales and confidence intervals.
Data
The sales data used in this project was generated with ChatGPT. It includes historical sales figures that were analyzed using the methods described above.

## Usage
